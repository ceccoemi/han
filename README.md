# HAN

Replication of some of the experiments reported in [1].

The main goal of these experiments is to compare the performances of a Hierarchical Attention Network with a classic BoW approach.

## Results

Document classification, in percentage

|               | **Yelp** | **Yahoo** | **Amazon** |
|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **BoW**       |   59.0   |   58.7    |    47.2    |
| **BoW-TFIDF** |   59.0   |   58.6    |    47.3    |
